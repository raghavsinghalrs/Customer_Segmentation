# Unsupervisedlearning
This is a project of unsupervised learning so you can guess I have unlabelled data on which I worked. I worked on a RFM model:
R refers to recency.
F refers to frequency.
M refers to monetary value.

By this model you can advertised any company's product by running campaigns on particular clusters.
